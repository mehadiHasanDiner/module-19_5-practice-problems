// Primitive data structure
// Primitive data structure is a data structure that can hold a single value in a specific location whereas the non-linear data structure can hold multiple values either in a contiguous location or random locations

// The examples of primitive data structure are float, character, integer and pointer. The value to the primitive data structure is provided by the programmer. The following are the four primitive data structures:

// Integer: The integer data type contains the numeric values. It contains the whole numbers that can be either negative or positive. When the range of integer data type is not large enough then in that case, we can use long.
// Float: The float is a data type that can hold decimal values. When the precision of decimal value increases then the Double data type is used.
// Boolean: It is a data type that can hold either a True or a False value. It is mainly used for checking the condition.
// Character: It is a data type that can hold a single character value both uppercase and lowercase such as 'A' or 'a'.
// Non-primitive data structure
// The non-primitive data structure is a kind of data structure that can hold multiple values either in a contiguous or random location. The non-primitive data types are defined by the programmer. The non-primitive data structure is further classified into two categories, i.e., linear and non-linear data structure.

// In case of linear data structure, the data is stored in a sequence, i.e., one data after another data. When we access the data from the linear data structure, we just need to start from one place and will find other data in a sequence.

// The following are the types of linear data structure:

// Array: An array is a data structure that can hold the elements of same type. It cannot contain the elements of different types like integer with character. The commonly used operation in an array is insertion, deletion, traversing, searching.
// For example:

// int a[6] = {1,2,3,4,5,6};

// The above example is an array that contains the integer type elements stored in a contiguous manner.

// String: String is defined as an array of characters. The difference between the character array and string is that the string data structure terminates with a 'NULL' character, and it is denoted as a '\0'.
